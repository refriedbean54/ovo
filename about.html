                    I've been making films since highschool, and been loving it ever since! my best highlights are that I've worked on a warner borthers movie, a adidas commercial, and have worked for the sacramento kings for 2 seasons.
                    i hope you take the time to look at some of my personal projects and work I've done thoroughout the years, and always look out for what's to come!
